# WalkTrack

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) app which allows users to record their location, and share it with others; in real-time.

## TODO:

- **Store location data from walks locally (perhaps sqlite).**

This allows us to upload walk history to walktrack server incase the websocket server cluster is having issues.

- A lot more stuff...
